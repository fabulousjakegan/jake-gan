## Goal 

Our goal is to explore and learn about the application of Generative Adversarial Networks in audio style transfer. We want to understand audio features and how they can be employed to imitate another voice. 

We have sourced the data for our project from the  Voice Conversion Challenge (public dataset ) which offers a 2GB data set of audio clips from four different speakers. The dataset offers both parallel and non parallel data.

Our focus would be to achieve the various tasks of the challenge. The first milestone would be converting the voice of each of the four speakers used in the parallel dataset into one another, with a harder optional task for training on non-parallel data. Along with it we would also be trying to implement style transfer over the voice data, such as gender based style transfer.
